# Themes

**This is a collection of themes for the [TcNo Account Switcher](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo-Acc-Switcher)**, A Super fast account switcher for Steam, Battle.net, Epic Games, Origin, Riot Games and Ubisoft (and more soon).
**Saves NO passwords** or any user information*. Most switchers, including Steam work purely off changing a file and a few registry keys.
*Wastes no time closing, switching and restarting Steam and other platforms.*


You can add your own theme by opening a Pull Request (See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md))

## Previews

Find a preview of all the themes in [THEMES.md](THEMES.md)

## Installation

- Download files related to the theme of your choice. Place the files into `%AppData%\TcNo Account Switcher\themes`.

- If the theme contains a `wwwroot` folder, extract those files into `%AppData%\TcNo Account Switcher\wwwroot`.

  Be careful of this, as scipts that replace program scripts could be malicious. Themes will be vetted as closely as possible to prevent this, but this is always a possibility with user-created content. All themes on this repo have been approved by TechNobo, creator of this project.

### Activating themes

Open the TcNo Account Switcher, click the Settings cogwheel icon, then next to `Current Style` select your preferred theme from the dropdown.
